# MATH_4800_001_FALL_2024
This is MATH 4800-001, the introduction to mathematics research for undergraduates class at the University of Utah, which focuses on fractal geometry and dynamics.

Each semester, MATH 4800 focuses on a particular topic, as detailed in the MATH 4800 archive. This semester, we will investigate fractals and dynamics. Fractals are objects that appear similar at different scales, and dynamics is the mathematical study of time evolutions of closed systems. Often, a fractal is the "residue" of a dynamical system that has evolved over a long time. For example, the Barnsley fern is the attractor of a specific iterated function system, and the Mandelbrot set is determined by whether the trajectory of a seed runs off to infinity under a certain dynamical system. This deep connection makes studying these two subjects together fruitful. While there are many applications of fractal geometry and dynamics, our starting point will be from a pure mathematics perspective. Exploration of applications will be admissible for assignments.
